# catcheckpassword
“Cute cat checking your password — meow!”  A fluffy cat sits by the screen, watching closely as you type. It taps the keyboard with its tiny paws, tilts its head, and softly meows while checking your password. If it’s correct, the cat happily purrs and meows “meow~!”. If not, it looks confused and waits for you to try again.
